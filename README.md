# 🌌 Echo-OS

**Echo-OS** is a next-generation, node-based virtual operating system built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It redefines the traditional user interface by transforming logic, data processing, and AI interaction into a dynamic ecosystem of interconnected nodes.

🚀 **Live Demo:** [luiszavoianu.github.io/Echo-OS/](https://luiszavoianu.github.io/Echo-OS/)
